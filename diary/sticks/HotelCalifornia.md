# Hotel California

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed my the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California
Any time of year
Any time of year
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot od pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said
We havent had that spirit here since 1969
And still those voices are calling form far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They're livin it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise
What a nice surprise
Bring your alibis

Mirrows one the ceiling
Pink champagne on ice
And she said
We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device
And in the masters chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Relax said the nightman
We are programed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave
